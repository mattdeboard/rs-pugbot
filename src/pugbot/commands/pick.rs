#[description(r#"(Captains Only) `pick #` adds player `#` to your team.

Once enough players to fill out all the teams have added themselves, captains will be automatically selected at random. One captain will be selected per team.

The bot will then display a numbered list of players, like so:

```
  Index     Player Name
----------|-------------
    1     | Alice
    2     | Bob
    3     | Charlie
```

Captains will be able to use the `~pick <index>` command."#
